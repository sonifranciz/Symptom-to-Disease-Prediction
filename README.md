Symptom to Disease Prediction using Text And Image Processing

#Project Object
1.The main aim of the project is early identification and fast medical action by providing users with 
immediate illness information, hence improving overall health outcomes.
2. The project has two daaset
   Dermnet: There are around 19,500 photographs 
   Symptom2Disease: There are 24 unique diseases in the dataset with 50 symptoms
3.For pre processing text data, TF-IDF vectorizer is used.
4.For image processing , normalization and augmentation techniques is used.
Several machine learning and deep learning models are implemented.
